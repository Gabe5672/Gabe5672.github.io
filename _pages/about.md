## Abstract (tl;dr)

COVID-19 is a specific strain of coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. While there is still much data being processed, it is predicted that the outbreak first started in Wuhan, China in late December/early January. Making its way to the United States a few weeks later. Since then, there have been a total of over 5 million cases just in the United States alone and it has acquired the title of pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked an unprecedented wave of research, data sharing and panic as the world seeks to understand the disease, track its spread and adjust to the new way of life.  

## Introduction

It is no question that the Covid-19 pandemic has altered everyday life. Analyzing data collected from the Harvard dataverse, ir can be inferred that COVID-19 has greatly affected areas with a large population density. Yet is it not evenly distributed amoung all states. Why is this the case? The attention must be directed towards the individual government of the states. 

## Hypothesis

Implementing prolonged stay home executive orders during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak decreases both the infection rate and death rate among a population. 

## Datasets used

The Data set used is The Harvard China Data Lab, 2020, "US COVID-19 Daily Cases with Basemap." Using that data, I constructed two graphs, one being "number of cases" and another of "the rate of change of the cases" for a few states. Those graphs can both be found in the index.RMD file.

## Description of analyses

Using calculus, I found the derivitive for the mentioned states to find the rate at wich the disease is spreading. Upon analyzing both graphs, it is evident that states such as michigan have improved in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. This is due to the fact that there is a inverse relationship between contraction rate and issuing of executive stay at home orders. Michigan had the executive stay at home order for a total of 70 days whereas states such as florida, only issued an executive stay at home order for 30 days.  

## Conclusions

In conclusion, I believe there is a positive correlation between COVID-19 deaths/infection rate and issuing of temporary stay home executive orders.
